## Getting started

We use Nix to ensure a consistent and reproducible dev environment. 

To get started, use the Nix installer provided by [Zero to Nix](https://zero-to-nix.com/start/install#up).

With Nix installed, run `nix develop` to enter the dev environment. Note, the first time you run it, it may take a while since it has to fetch all the packages. Subsequent runs are much faster.
